# OPENAI4J [![tests](https://github.com/sigpwned/openai4j/actions/workflows/tests.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sigpwned/openai4j/actions/workflows/tests.yml)

OpenAI4j is an [OpenAI API](https://openai.com/blog/openai-api) client for Java 11 or later. It is generated from the [OpenAI API OpenAPI spec](https://github.com/openai/openai-openapi) using the excellent [OpenAPI Generator](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator), which is why this repo is (mostly) empty except for a POM and OpenAPI spec.

## Goals

* To provide an easy-to-use Java client for the OpenAI API
* To stay in sync with the OpenAI API as changes are made
* To minimize maintenance effort by generating code
* To require a minimum of dependencies

## Non-Goals

* To support the API spec as written, since it requires changes to generate valid Java code
* No dependencies

## Example Code
